Their synergy\npromises to revolutionize the development of Gen-AI applications, transforming months of work into just hours.\nIn this talk, we will explore how modern ML/AI technologies, applied to real-world scenarios, can benefit from a\ncomposable approach to quickly address complex needs with contextualized and updated data. We will discuss the\nchallenges related to the implementation of these scalable solutions and the crucial role of Platform Engineering\nin reducing complexity and accelerating innovation. We will explore how the power of advanced architectures and\nplatform engineering strategies can radically transform the landscape of “intelligent application” development.</p>\n","article":{"title":"MLOps @localhost 2024","date":"2024-05-21T09:00:00Z","image":"https://michelmurabito.com/conferences/2024/Michel_Murabito-MLOps-@localhost-2024.webp","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUv-suECYJ4"}},"schema":{}},"__N_SSG":true}
