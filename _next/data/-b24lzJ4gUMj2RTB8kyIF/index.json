This event, supported by the CNCF (Cloud-Native Computing Foundation) and organized by the Italian Kubernetes community, was a remarkable moment of connection, learning, and inspiration.\n\nThe true heart of KCD Italy is the community. Organizing such an event, by the community for the community, has been an incredibly rewarding experience. We saw around 300 participants come together to share knowledge, stories, and innovations in the Open Source and Cloud-Native technologies. The sense of belonging and the desire to contribute to collective growth were palpable in every corner of the Savoia Regency Hotel in Bologna on June 20, 2024.\n\nWe had the privilege of listening to established experts, emerging figures, and enthusiasts from the Cloud-Native world. The talks ranged from ephemeral clusters as a service, to the challenges of building a cloud for AI, to adventures in security. Each presentation offered valuable insights and sparked vibrant discussions among the participants.\n\nOne of the most beautiful aspects of KCD Italy was the networking. The sponsor areas and coffee breaks were ideal moments to forge new friendships, discuss projects, and exchange innovative ideas. The Kubernetes community is truly special: open, inclusive, and always ready to support each other.\n\nI would like to thank everyone who participated and made this event possible. The speakers, with their inspiring presentations, the sponsors who supported the event, and of course all the participants who, with their energy and passion, created a unique atmosphere. It was truly exciting to see so many people united by the same passion for Kubernetes and Cloud-Native technologies.\n\nOrganizing an event of this magnitude requires commitment and dedication, but seeing the enthusiasm and interest of the participants was the greatest reward. We look forward to seeing how the community will grow and evolve in the coming year, and we are already excited for the 2025 edition.\n\nThank you all from the bottom of my heart for making KCD Italy 2024 an unforgettable success. Keep sharing, learning, and growing together. See you next time!\n\nA special thanks to [Mia-Platform](https://www.mia-platform.eu) for giving me the opportunity to actively contribute to the realization of this event.\n\nFor more details about the organizers and the event, visit [this page](https://kcd.pizza/).\nIf you want to stay updated on all the latest news, you can also follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kcditaly/) and [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/kcditaly)\n\n","metadata":{"title":"KCD Italy 2024: an event from the community to the community","excerpt":"The Kubernetes Community Day Italy 2024 was an extraordinary event with 300 participants, prominent speakers, and numerous networking opportunities.

I'm **Michel Murabito**, but everyone calls me **Mich** (pronounced *Mitch*), a fervent Developer Advocate at **Mia-Platform**, with my roots deeply embedded in the beautiful land of Sicily and my heart beating in the fast-paced rhythm of Milan.\n\n## Who I Am\n\nBorn in Turin in 1986 and raised under the sun of Sicily, I started writing code at the age of 12, driven by curiosity and a passion for technology that still fuels every day of my life. My professional career kicked off at 18 as a software developer, and since then, I've never stopped exploring new horizons in the vast world of IT.\n\n## What I Do\n\nToday, I find myself in the role of Developer Advocate at **Mia-Platform**, where I have the opportunity to merge my passion for technology with that for communication, working closely with the developer community. My goal is to make developers' lives simpler and more productive, through sharing knowledge, experiences, and best practices.\n\n## My Passions\n\nBeyond my professional commitment, I am deeply involved in promoting sustainability in IT, a theme I consider crucial for the future of our planet and our industry. I am also an active contributor to the open source community, a staunch supporter of continuous learning, and a passionate speaker at national and international tech events.\n\n### A Deeper Dive into My Interests\n\nMy enthusiasm doesn't stop there; I am particularly passionate about **Cloud Native technologies, Platform Engineering, and enhancing the Developer Experience**. These fields represent the cutting edge of creating scalable, resilient, and efficient software solutions. They are also about building communities and ecosystems where developers can thrive, innovate, and deliver outstanding value rapidly and reliably.\n\n## Why a Blog?\n\nI've decided to start this blog to share my reflections, discoveries, and experiences on this journey through the world of technology. Here you'll find articles on platform engineering, sustainability, advocacy, and much more.\n\nI invite every reader to interact, share opinions, and experiences: I firmly believe in the value of community and constructive dialogue.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read these lines. I'm excited about embarking on this path with you.\n\nUntil next time!\nMich\n","metadata":{"title":"Hello World (again) Its me, Mich!","excerpt":"Hello everyone!
