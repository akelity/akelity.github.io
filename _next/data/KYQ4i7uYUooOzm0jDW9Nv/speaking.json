Their synergy promises to revolutionize the development of Gen-AI applications, transforming months of work into just hours. In this talk, we will explore how modern ML/AI technologies, applied to real-world scenarios, can benefit from a composable approach to quickly address complex needs with contextualized and updated data.\n\nWe will discuss the challenges related to the implementation of these scalable solutions and the crucial role of Platform Engineering in reducing complexity and accelerating innovation. We will explore how the power of advanced architectures and platform engineering strategies can radically transform the landscape of “intelligent application” development.","contentUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUv-suECYJ4"}]},"href":"speaking/2024-05-mlops-localhost","title":"Compose GenAI Apps: May the Force Be with Your Data and Models","description":"Online","event":"MLOps @localhost","date":"May 21, 2024","cta":""},{"raw":{"@type":"Event","name":"Cloud Native London","startDate":"2024-04-03T19:00:00Z","endDate":"2024-04-03T20:30:00Z","location":{"@type":"VirtualLocation","url":"https://www.oicheryl.com/2024/04/03/cloud-native-london-april-2024/"},"url":"https://www.oicheryl.com/2024/04/03/cloud-native-london-april-2024/","organizer":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Cloud Native London","url":"https://www.meetup.com/cloud-native-london/"},"eventAttendanceMode":"OnlineEventAttendanceMode","workPerformed":[{"@type":"PresentationDigitalDocument","name":"How to turn Cognitive Load into creativity","description":"We will dive into the dynamic field of platform engineering, a driving force in reducing cognitive load and increasing developer productivity.
